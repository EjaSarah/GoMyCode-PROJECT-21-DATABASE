        Comparison Between Nosql and Sql Database. Written By Sarah Ogbonna SQL
        VS NOSQL SQL databases are suitable for structured data, where data is
        consistent, and relationships between tables are well-defined. In
        contrast, NoSQL databases are suitable for semi-structured or
        unstructured data, where the data does not conform to a predefined
        schema, and relationships between data elements are not well-defined.
        SQL databases are typically used in applications that require complex
        queries and transaction management, whereas NoSQL databases are used in
        applications that require high performance and scalability, such as web
        applications and mobile apps. SQL Database Systems: Here are some of the
        most popular sql database system MySQL Free and open-source An extremely
        established database with a huge community, extensive testing, and lots
        of stability Supports all major platforms Replication and sharding are
        available Covers a wide range of use cases Oracle Commercial database
        with frequent updates, professional management, and excellent customer
        support Procedural Language/SQL or PL/SQL is the SQL dialect used One of
        the most expensive database solutions Works with huge databases Simple
        upgrades Transaction control Compatible with all operating systems
        Suitable for enterprises and organizations with demanding workloads
        Microsoft SQL Server A commercial database developed and managed by
        Microsoft Transact SQL, or T-SQL, is the SQL dialect used Only works
        with Windows and Linux User-friendly Difficult to make adjustments
        mid-process when finding errors Excellent documentation Works well for
        small-to-medium-sized organizations that want a commercial database
        solution without the cost of Oracle PostgreSQL Object-oriented database
        management system, meaning it’s a hybrid SQL/NoSQL database solution
        Free and open-source Compatibility with a wide range of operating
        systems Active community and many third-party service providers High
        ACID compliance Uses pure SQL Works best for use cases where data
        doesn’t support a relational model. It also works well for extra-large
        databases and when running complicated queries NoSQL Database Systems
        Here are a couple of the most popular NoSQL database systems: MongoDB By
        far the most popular NoSQL database, and for good reason Free to use
        Dynamic schema Horizontally scalable Excellent performance with simple
        queries Add new columns and fields without impacting your existing rows
        or application performance Works best for companies going through rapid
        growth stages or those with a lot of unstructured data Lesser-known
        alternatives to MongoDB include Apache Cassandra, Google Cloud BigTable,
        and Apache HBase Cassandra Handles large amounts of data across
        commodity servers High availability with no point of failure Follows
        peer-to-peer architecture Scalable Open-source
